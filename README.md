# Library
This Portfolio Has multiple questions with multiple parts.
The system for this is:
A library system that should allow users to:
- Search for books by title, author, or keyword
- View details about a book, including its title, author, publication date, and available 
copies
- Borrow a book from the library
- Return a book to the library
- View a list of books currently borrowed by the user
The library system should keep track of:
- A list of books in the library, including their titles, authors, publication dates, 
and number of copies
- A list of users, including their names, email addresses, and borrowed books.
- The availability of each book in the library
- The due date for each borrowed book
The library system should enforce the following rules:
- A user cannot borrow more than three books at a time.
- A user cannot borrow a book that is not available.
- A user must return a borrowed book before borrowing another book.
- A user must return a borrowed book by its due date to avoid late fees.
The library system should provide the following outputs:
- A list of all books in the library
- A list of all borrowed books, including their due dates and the names of the 
users who borrowed them.
- A list of all users who have borrowed books, including the titles of the books 
they have borrowed and their due dates
